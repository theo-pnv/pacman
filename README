# Pacman

This is a small project written in C on my free-time. It is still under development, and may not be playable with a fully experience.

## Installation

* `$ make` to build the project and get the binary file.
* `$ make clean` to remove compilation files

## Project

Updates are programmed to take place on a regular basis. On the first time, I'll focus on stability and performance updates, but very soon, new features will be implemented !
